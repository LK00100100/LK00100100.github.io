					<h1>Grinding Leetcode and Hackerrank</h1>

					<p>
						6/21/2019
						<br><br>
						Love programming? Want to get better? Or do you want to get a programming job?
						Then look no further than Leetcode and hackerrank. Dreaded by <a
							href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">r/cscareerquesitons</a>
						for being "stupid." With the amount of money in the field, there'll be a lot of
						people trying to squeeze their way in by any means necessary. The only way to
						get the right programmers is to ask them programming questions relevant to the
						job. Here's a rant from a Googler who hates interviewing people because most of them are
						terrible
						<a
							href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1z97rx/from_a_googler_the_google_interview_process/">(link)</a>.
						Here's a rant about programmers who can't do basic control flow
						<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest">(link)</a>
						<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/">(Leetcode)</a>.
						<br><br>
						I personally find these articles hard to believe, but I know people who have shadowed
						in interviews and they say otherwise.

						<br>
						Even after programming for two years in college, I still had diffculty doing harder problems.
						The key is to just grind. In order to get good at anything, you need to do that thing a lot.
						Malcolm Gladwell estimates that 10,000 hours of practice will make you a world expert.
						One shouldn't be disheartened by the monumental task of grinding. The only surefire way,
						which has worked for me personally, is to just chip away at it slowly over a long period of
						time.
						<br><br>
						If you read 10 pages a day, you'll have read ~3,650 pages by the end of the year. If you solve
						3 questions a week, by the end of the year, you'll have solved ~150 questions. I used to do
						questions on the train by paper and pen, but now I do that occasionally. For leetcode contests,
						I'll model the problem on a clipboard with a 4-color Bic Pen and then code something quickly.
						Normally, I'll solve at least 2, maybe 3 questions and that'll put me in the top 20% in
						these contests

						As a final note, the problem with programming is that there are so many different specialities
						with their own sub-specialties. You may end up doing leetcode well but things like security or
						web
						app development terribly. So don't just train, go build something!
						<br><br>
						Here are some books recommended by Google to help you with Leetcode/Hackerrank
