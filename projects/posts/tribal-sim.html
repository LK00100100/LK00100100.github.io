						Work in progress. (Playable)
						<br><br>
						Tribal Simulator is a civilization-like turn-based strategy game. The game takes
						place in the far post-apocalyptic future. So you may see things like robots, mutants
						,and space-related weapons in later updates.
						<br><br>
						The main thing that differentiates this game from many other strategy games is
						its emphasis on logistics and control of limited resources. The limited resources
						are: manpower, land, food, and raw building materials.
						<br><br>
						So you have a base where you utilize a population of people to harness the
						resources of the nearby area. If you wanted to wage war on a nearby nation, you'd have
						to raise an army, supply them with enough resources for the campaign, and then set them
						off. During the adventure, you have to hope you don't run out of resources or else you'll
						starve to death. You also have to hope that you didn't send too many people out because
						you still have to defend your homeland.
						<br><br>
						The game is playable. However, the AI is pretty bad and this one level does not
						have any real challenge. The level has been designed to where the AI will not
						try to attack your base. The only way you can die is if you sent all your people
						to the desert and let them starve to death. Also, the resources are way too plentiful.
						<br><br>
						There's a ton of features I'd like to implement. Such as diplomacy, trade routes and,
						single-player scenarios (to name a few).
