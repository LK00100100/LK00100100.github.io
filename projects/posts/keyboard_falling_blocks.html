							here! (use chrome)(not available on mobile)</a>
						<br><br>
						This is basically a "keyboard Tetris." You play using 40-keys on your keyboard.
						<br>
						1st row does 0 rotations: Keys [1 through 0]<br>
						2nd row does 1 rotations: Keys [q through p]<br>
						3rd row does 2 rotations: Keys [a through ;]<br>
						4th row does 3 rotations: Keys [z through /]<br>
						<br>
						1st column moves the piece to column 0: Keys [1 through z]<br>
						2nd column moves the piece to column 1: Keys [2 through x]<br>
						etc etc
						<br>
						Shift to hold keys. Enter to restart. Back to go back. Space to cancel any keys being
						pressed-down.
						<br><br>
						In theory, you can play at the speed of thought and play much faster than what is possible.
						The
						bad thing is that the learning curve is steep and the amount of people who give up are
						pretty
						high. Most people don't even want to read the 2-page manual, which is 2 pages too many.
						First players normally take 10 minutes to complete 40 lines (10 tetrises).
						<br><br>
						After creating this game, I posted it on the Tetris community. People really enjoyed playing
						it.
						Some have brought to my attention that similiar such games have been created such as the
						video below.
						Here's a game called Finesse...

						My game was coded with outdated javascript so you'll see a lot of "vars," global variables,
						and other ugly stuff. As of this, writing (mid 2019), the best options are ECMAScript2015
						(ES6), Babel
						(like a future version of JS), or Typescript (Microsoft's flavor of JS).
						<br><br>
						What did I learn from this? Most people don't like reading manuals. Most people don't like
						installing
						stuff and would rather click a link. Most people don't like huge learning curves.
						<br><br>
						Here's the code. Just don't try to make any money off of it or the Tetris folks will
						probably sue you.
