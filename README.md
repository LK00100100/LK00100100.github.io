Dev Notes: Use npm's http-server to help you develop. Browsers do not like opening up files directly from the file system. Use Ctrl + Shift + R for a hard refresh.

In the folder with index.html, type the command
```
http-server
```
It will display a list of addresses.
Then open up the browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/index.html
```
