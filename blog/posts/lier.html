					<h1>Long Island Expressway Raceway (LIER)</h1>
					<p>
						8/14/2019
						<br><br>
						Taxes here in Long Island, New York are crazy! The average cost of annual property taxes is
						$10,000. Governments have a tendency to just spend more and more. The usual solutions are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stop spending so damn much (governments hate this)</li>
						<li>Raise taxes (people hate this)</li>
						<li>Borrow money (everyone hates this)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						HOWEVER, I have a BIG-BRAIN 4th proposal.
						<br><br>
						I would like to propose turning the Long Island Expressway into a raceway for a few hours
						for one day per year, every year. It would be done on a non-busy day during non-busy
						hours to lower economic costs. We could call this proposition the "Long Island Expressway
						Raceway (LIER)."
						<br><br>
						There are quite a number of speed demons on Long Island, and I'm sure many of them would
						donate a lot of money to go as fast as humanly possible on a lengthy, closed stretch of
						road without any legal (or human) hindrance. Given the limited amount of "non-busy" LIER
						time, we can slice up the time into many one-way trip "time slots" and sell one slot to
						one person. That one person (or people) will rent the designated slice of the LIER for a
						limited amount of time
						<br><br>
						To gauge the value of these "time slots", one would have to find rich speed demons and
						find out. Some vehicles and automobiles can go in excess of 200 mph and more! This amount
						of speed requires world class vehicles with the finest level of human engineering. These
						cost A LOT of money. There are plenty of auto shows and motorcycle shows which cater to
						such wealthy people. You can ask these people how much they are willing to pay to see if
						the LIER is an economically viable idea.
						<br><br>
						This could be an annual fund raiser type event with people rallying and live-streaming
						(from inside the car) this event through the internet (for free) thus attracting more
						people from outside Long Island and probably even out of the country. People would
						definitely want to watch insane people with the fastest, most expensive, exotic super cars and
						motorcycles travel at ludicrous speeds. The event has never been done before and thus would
						attract a lot of attention and thus even more wealthy donators (and celebrities) and
						advertisers. The money raked in can be used to enhance the roads and lower taxes. With the
						level of viewers, the attention can be further used to bring awareness to certain
						social issues such as Long Island's drug problems.
						<br><br>
						To fuel even more levels of competition, we can have an online LIER leaderboard and list
						of records to bring even more jealously and fuel further levels of petty competition thus
						bringing in even more insane expensive cars which means more expensive donators. We can
						have many variations of leaderboards such as: car model, motorcycle model, overall time,
						age range, and more. We can further idolize these record holders by giving them attention,
						recognition, special license plates, and trophies. People will pay a lot for vanity. We
						need vanity license plates.
						<br><br>
						I would imagine that these racers would not want to do this just once. We can give each donator
						an individual unique id and racing profile and bio on the LIER website.
						<br><br>
						The only massive concern is safety. One must recognize that the individual has the right to
						bear his own risk and that the government is not responsible for his risky decisions. The
						government can absolve self blame by passing it on to the driver who will sign a death waiver.
						We can mitigate risk by having a "one driver at a time" rule (unless the donator wants more
						during his time slot). We can also use the police to close off the raceway section to prevent
						people from wandering into a death zone. We can also give the driver a radio and mark off
						sections of the road with colored flags to warn the driver to slow down before the end of the
						LIER. Also, certain areas of the road can be marked off with "impending turn" signs to give the
						driver advance warning of turns. Sobriety tests can be done on the driver to ensure that he is
						not "doped-up." We can have many ambulances and firemen on stand-by to save an injured person
						from a burning wreckage.
						<br><br>
						Also, these cars should not be required to be completely street legal such as having headlights
						and mirrors. Such illegal vehicles can be towed to the site.
						<br><br>
						I believe the benefits greatly outweigh the risks and such a proposition would be a lot fun and
						would benefit Long Island (and New York) financially and put it on the map.
						<br><br>
						P.S. I sent this proposal to my congressman a few years ago and they ignored me! Can you believe
						that? A congressman not liking money? Who heard of that???
						<br><br>
						P.P.S. If this ever passes into law, give me a free turn on the LIER. Thanks.
						<br><br>
						P.P.P.S. If you think this is ridiculous solution, it's because this is a ridiculous problem.
