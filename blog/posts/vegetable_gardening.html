				<h1>On Vegetable Gardening</h1>
				<img src="img/my_corn.jpg" title="My own Silver Queen Corn" />
				<p>
					6/9/2019
					<br /><br />
					I've been growing vegetables for a few years. It's pretty fun bringing life from the seed into
					this planet. It also takes a little bit of work. But before I begin, I have to define what a
					"vegetable" due to a lot of confusion. The US congress has declared "pizza sauce" as a vegetable
					serving. And then people end up mutating this into "pizza is a vegetable." It's like the
					"telephone game."
					<br /><br />
					The real definition of a fruit is an enlarged ovary from a plant. Plants will eventually have
					flowers which will get fertilized by other plants or itself (depends on the plant). The flowers
					will then turn into fruits like: tomatoes, apples, peppers, corn, blueberries, avocados,
					cucumbers, peas.
					The real definition of a vegetable is anything that isn't the fruit such as: cabbages (leaves),
					lettuce (leaves), asparagus (young plant), potatoes (roots), broccoli (flower head), carrots
					(roots).
					<br /><br />
					Some fruits are called vegetables due to (as far as I know) people mixing up the definitions. To
					be fair, I didn't know that broccoli was an unbloomed flower head until I started gardening as
					an adult. I'm sure the average person has never grown anything other than those 4th-grade
					plant-in-a-cup that ends up dying.
					<br /><br />
					All you need is some good dirt, some sun, some fertilizer and some water. Growing vegetables
					isn't like growing a weed however. It ain't that easy.
					<br /><br />
					I liken this experience to raising kids. You set them up for success in the early years
					and then they're good forever. Otherwise, they become susceptible to pests and disease and
					fruitlessness.

				<h2>Plant Selection</h2>
				<p>
					To start off, you have to decide what kind of vegetables you want.
					You can go to a store and buy a some partially grown vegetables and save some time and enjoy
					a plant for an extra month compared to that grown from seed.
					If you'd like some more exotic varieties, you can visit a place like
					<a href="http://www.burpee.com">Burpee</a> and buy some weird varieties. Like blue potatoes,
					red corn, pear-shaped tomatoes, "walking" onions, and more.
					<br /><br />
					Some specific plants enjoy the company of other specific plants. Some plants do not like
					other plants. This is called "companion planting." Don't plant the things from the same family
					for 2 years in the same soil. There are specific diseases and pests that may be lurking from
					last year's harvest. You may be surprised that watermelons and cucumbers come from the same
					family. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbitaceae">(wiki)</a>
					<br /><br />
					Every plant germinates faster in specific temperatures. After germination, their desired
					temperature may change. You'll have to be careful for "frost." You'll have to check the
					<b>last frost date</b> for where you are at. If not, your plant may freeze at night and die.
				</p>

				<h2>The Plot</h2>
				<p>
					Pick an area that gets plenty of sunlight. These vegetable plants need as much
					sunlight as possible. At least 8 hours of "Full Sun." It should be free of human
					and animal pests. You can stink up the place with your daily presence to scare
					animals. Attempt to loosen the soil with the use of tools like the garden claw
					or a pickaxe. Go as low as you can go. Then pile on more loose soil on top.
					<br /><br />
					If you are growing plants from a container, then use some of that sterile
					Miracle-Gro soil. It'll be free of weed seeds which normally infest ground soil
					with infinite amounts. Ensure that your future plant has enough dirt.
					<a
						href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=container+growing+vegetables">(ref)</a>
					<br /><br />
					You may need to enrich the soil with compost. You can even buy some worms to help aerate
					and loosen the soil and create more nutrients.
				</p>

				<h2>Planting</h2>
				<p>
					If you are growing by seed, each plant has specific instructions with sowing and spacing.
					They're normally written on the back of the seed packet. I normally plant multiple seeds
					and then prune the weaker seedlings. You maintain spacing so the plants aren't all choking
					each other. Some plants may have specific needs. For example, corn has a shallow root system.
					So they will require a drip irrigation system to keep the top-soil constantly moist.
				</p>

				<h2>Start</h2>
				<p>
					I normally use Miracle-Gro soil. It's dark, earthy-smelling soil that's moist and porous.
					The porous soil allows water to freely move around and the roots to push through. The pH level
					(pH 7) is around neutral so most plants will grow with this soil. Some plants enjoy more
					acidic (towards pH 0) or basic (towards pH 14).
					<br /><br />
					Plants survive off of 3 key nutrients. They are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Also known
					as "NPK." If you see 3 numbers on plant food, they refer to the NPK ratio respectively. Use
					more nitrogen for more leaf growth. More phosphorus for more flowers and fruits. Potassium
					is good for roots and general health. I use Miracle-Gro all-purpose fertilizer once every 2
					weeks (if needed). Too many nutrients will kill the plant.
					<br /><br />
					You'll need to water deeply to give the plants a reason to grow their roots even lower. You
					can drown the plant so don't water until the top is completely flooded. Don't water at night
					since there's no sun to help evaporate the water. The excess moisture will cause mold and diease.
					<br /><br />
					If you see weeds, be careful if they are near your seedlings. Their roots may be intertwined.
					You may need to just cut their leaves and cover them up to prevent them from getting sun. You
					may want to use mulch to prevent weeds from getting through, to raise soil temperature, and to
					retain moisture. You can also use covers or mini-green houses for a similiar result.
				</p>

				<h2>Middle</h2>
				<p>
					The plant is now growing well. Water deeply, fertilize if needed, and kill the pests.
					You may want to switch to a fertilizer with a higher phosphorus ratio to encourage flowering.
					The more fruit you pick, the more fruit the plant grows. Some fruit can become overripe and
					disgusting. Cucumbers can become massive and woody. Corn can become deflated and dried. Some
					plants require pruning scissors to cleanly cut off the fruit. Sometimes, you can just twist
					and pull gently.
					<br /><br />
					Your plants should be large enough to prevent sunlight from getting through the rest of the
					soil. This will help prevent weeds.
					<br /><br />
					If your plants are turning yellow, you may need to fertilize with nitrogen.
				</p>

				<h2>End</h2>
				<p>
					The plant is now in its last phase of life. Fall is here. The plants will now wilt
					and turn yellow for good. A lot of these vegetable plants only live as "annuals," only one year.
					If you live in a warmer area, your plant may live longer than one year (perennials)
					such as peppers in Florida. You can take your dead plants and then put them into compost
					pile where they will rot and turn into new soil.
				</p>

				<h2>Composting</h2>
				<p>
					Composting is where you take a bunch of rotting stuff and put it in a pile or a
					container. It may take 1-2 for the dead matter to become earthy-smelling, black, rich
					soil. I don't recommend using meat since this will drive the nearby wildlife insane. You
					can buy a composting bin or build your own.
				</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					If your plants are perfectly healthy then they are more resistant to pests and disease.
					However, if your plants are dying due to lack of sun or too much rain or not enough
					nutrients, then they make for easy targets for bugs, disease, and mold.
				</p>

				<h2>Pests and Diease</h2>
				<p>
					For tomatoes and peppers, you may encounter "blossom end rot." This is when your plants
					appear to be rotting. You will need to add calcium in the form of bonemeal.
					<br /><br />
					If you have some bugs, you can either invite some bug killers. One time I had a biblical
					aphid infestation on my Silver Queen corn. Aphids look like little pale green dots. I
					bought some ladybugs to kill all of the aphids. You can also invite some birds.
					<br /><br />
					For some diseases, you may need to cut off pieces of the plant or even kill the whole plant
					to prevent further infestation.
				</p>

				<h2>Reproduction</h2>
				<p>
					Some methods yield better results than others for some plants.
					Some plants reproduce either by:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-circle">
					<li>
						Cloning : You can clone the tomato plant with just a piece of the plant. A branch can grow
						roots. Potatoes can clone themselves from pieces (called seed potatoes).
					</li>
					<li>
						Seeds : Just wait until the plant fruits and then let the seeds overripen and dry.
					</li>
					<li>
						Grafting: You can cut off a branch off of one plant and stick it on another plant. This
						works
						for some plants.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Misc.</h2>
				<p>
					Mushrooms are ok. Clovers will put nitrogen back in the soil so they're ok too.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					This is just the basics. I've just summarized everything in one sitting from memory so I
					may be missing some details. This is the book I read many years ago.
					<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vegetable-Gardeners-Bible-2nd-R-D/dp/160342475X">(book)</a>
					If you are looking for something more complicated, you should check out this book on
					Marijuana growing. These people are super serious.
